## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SASS custom properties

### What I learned

I'm getting a better understanding of sass and this time I played with flex and positioning. I'm also taking the time to personally understand the  order in which certain elements should be wrapped.

## Acknowledgments

For many of these projects, it seems I'll be using Figma to map out the dimensions of how I might want to design the websites. This doesn't allow me to perfectly replicate the challenges but gets me close enough to be satisfied. If I were to do this again, instead of using Figma to make the profile image round, I should have practiced using clip paths. The link below is a really good resource for helping you achieve the desired effect.

Other than that, everything else was fairly straightforward, and I would recommend personalizing this project for actual use. Also, based on the original image, I have broken it down into three parts. If you look at my code, I have the main as the container, and then it's split up into a header and an unordered list (for the buttons). Not that it is necessary, but I would also add two additional meta tags (keywords and description).
